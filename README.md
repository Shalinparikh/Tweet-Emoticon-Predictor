# Twitter Emoticon Predictor
The main aim of the project is to predict the emoticons that a user would use for a tweet. The emoticon is determined by analyzing the sentiment of the tweet and then doing a multi-class classification using Bi-directional LSTMs. Used `TweetTokenizer` to tokenise sentenences, `Glove package` for word embeddings and performed `SMOTE` to take care of the imbalanced data set.
